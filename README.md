## Features

1. **Official CachyOS Version Checking:** Queries the official [CachyOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux/releases) and [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/CachyOS/linux-cachyos) to detect the latest stable CachyOS kernel release (e.g. 7.2.10).
2. **System Comparison:** Automatically verifies whether your currently running kernel matches the latest CachyOS release.
3. **Automated Source & Config Download:** Downloads the pre-patched official CachyOS kernel tree and the official CachyOS `.config`.
4. **Containerized Compilation (Podman / Docker):**
   * Optionally compile inside an isolated `debian:bookworm-slim` container environment using **Podman** or **Docker**.
   * Provides 100% reproducible builds and generic compatibility across Debian Bookworm, Trixie, Sid, and derivatives without polluting your host system.
5. **⚡ Compile for My System (Experimental):**
   * **Hardware Auto-Detection:** Automatically scans your machine's CPU vendor (Intel/AMD), CPU model, thread count, form-factor (laptop battery vs desktop), root filesystem, and active hardware modules.
   * **Native CPU Optimization (`-march=native`):** Directs the compiler to utilize your exact CPU microarchitecture instructions (AVX2, AVX-512, BMI2, modern cache line sizes) for maximum responsiveness.
   * **Hardware-Tailored Drivers (`make localmodconfig`):** Scans active hardware modules and trims thousands of unused drivers for hardware not present on your system, reducing compile times from 45–90 minutes down to ~10–20 minutes!
   * **Baseline Safeguards:** Enforces essential storage controllers (NVMe, SATA), filesystems (ext4, btrfs, vfat, ntfs3), and USB input/storage classes so your system always boots reliably.
6. **🔐 In-App UEFI Secure Boot (MOK) Signing & Enrollment Wizard:**
   * **Automatic Post-Build Signing:** Automatically unpacks built `.deb` packages, signs `/boot/vmlinuz-*` with `sbsign`, verifies signature integrity with `sbverify`, and repacks `.deb` packages in-place.
   * **In-App MOK Enrollment:** Prompts for a one-time enrollment password directly inside the GUI and stages the key into NVRAM via `pkexec mokutil --import` for approval on next reboot.
   * **Standalone Signing Tools:** Sign existing packages on demand, enroll MOK keys, or sign `/boot/vmlinuz-*` directly.
7. **Organized Output in `~/kernel-build-deb/`:**
   * Prompts the user to grant permission to create the output folder in their home directory.
   * Collects all generated `.deb` packages (`linux-image`, `linux-headers`), `kernel.config`, and a self-contained `install.sh` helper into `/home/$USER/kernel-build-deb/Linux-kernel-CachyOS-(version)-debian/` (or `-native-debian/`).
8. **Optimized Compilation (`make bindeb-pkg`):**
   * Configures the kernel with CachyOS scheduler and performance optimizations.
   * Sanitizes Debian certificate traps (`SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=""`, `SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS=""`) and module keys to ensure failure-free builds on both host and containers.
   * Compiles the kernel into native `.deb` packages using all available CPU threads.
9. **Polkit Privilege Escalation:** Safely invokes `pkexec` for native password prompts when installing or purging packages, importing MOK keys, and updating GRUB.
10. **Kernel Rollback:** Lists installed `linux-image-*` packages in a safety-first UI dialog, allowing you to purge previous kernels and automatically restore older kernel entries in GRUB.
11. **Cache Cleanup & Persistent Config Recovery:** Checks and cleans `~/.cache/cachy-kernel-build` every time the app opens, preventing disk bloat while automatically saving and recovering your generated kernel `.config` across kernel updates.
12. **One-Click Build Dependencies Installer:** Built-in "Install Dependencies" button to verify and install all required kernel compiler tools directly from the GUI.
13. **Modern Native UI:** Built with **GTK4** and **Libadwaita**, providing dark mode support, titlebar controls, and live terminal logging.

## ⚡ Experimental Feature: "Compile for My System"

The **"Compile for my system"** switch enables automated hardware auto-detection to build an optimized, machine-tailored CachyOS kernel rather than a generic one-size-fits-all build:

### What It Does:
* **Silicon-Level Optimization (`-march=native`):** Configures the kernel with `CONFIG_X86_NATIVE_CPU=y` (and CachyOS native compiler flags), instructing GCC to utilize all instruction sets supported by your exact processor (e.g. AVX2, AVX-512, BMI2, AES-NI, FMA, and modern cache-line tuning).
* **Hardware-Tailored Driver Stripping (`make localmodconfig`):** Generic distribution kernels compile over 5,000 drivers for thousands of ancient or obscure controllers. The app snapshots your running hardware via `lsmod` and trims away drivers for hardware not physically present on your machine.
* **Dramatically Faster Builds:** Cuts compilation time from **45–90 minutes down to ~10–20 minutes** on typical multi-core CPUs, while also reducing kernel image and initramfs size.
* **Form-Factor & Power Management:** Detects whether you are running on a laptop (battery detected) or desktop, configuring optimal CPU frequency governors (`AMD P-State EPP` / `Intel P-State`), timer tick behavior, and vendor-specific ACPI modules (e.g., ThinkPad, Dell, ASUS).
* **Baseline Safeguards:** Enforces core storage drivers (NVMe, AHCI/SATA), vital filesystems (`ext4`, `btrfs`, `vfat`, `ntfs3`), and USB HID input devices so your system boots reliably and external drives continue to work.
* **Isolated Output:** System-tailored builds are labeled with the `-cachyos-native-debian` localversion and organized into `~/kernel-build-deb/Linux-kernel-CachyOS-(version)-native-debian/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Portability Notice:**
> A kernel compiled with "Compile for my system" is tailored specifically for the machine on which it was built. The resulting `.deb` packages should not be installed on another PC with different hardware or a different CPU generation.

## Installation

### Method 1: Official Debian APT Repository (Recommended)

Installing via our official APT repository enables automatic updates alongside your system packages (`sudo apt upgrade`):

```bash
# 1. Download and install the repository GPG signing key
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://antux912012.github.io/debian-cachy-kernel-updater/KEY.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/cachy-kernel-updater.gpg

# 2. Add the repository to your APT sources
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/cachy-kernel-updater.gpg] https://antux912012.github.io/debian-cachy-kernel-updater stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cachy-kernel-updater.list

# 3. Update package index and install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cachy-kernel-updater
```

> [!TIP]

---

### Method 2: Direct `.deb` Package Download

Download the pre-compiled `.deb` package from the [v1.1.2 Release Page](https://github.com/Antux912012/debian-cachy-kernel-updater/releases/tag/v1.1.2):

* 📦 **[cachy-kernel-updater_1.1.2_all.deb](https://github.com/Antux912012/debian-cachy-kernel-updater/releases/download/v1.1.2/cachy-kernel-updater_1.1.2_all.deb)**

Install it using `apt` (which automatically installs any missing dependencies):
```bash
sudo apt install -y ./cachy-kernel-updater_1.1.2_all.deb
```

---

### Method 3: Standalone Flatpak Bundle

Download and install the standalone `.flatpak` bundle:
```bash
flatpak install --user cachy-kernel-updater_1.1.2.flatpak
```
Or run directly:
```bash
flatpak run org.cachyos.debian.kernelupdater
```

---

### Method 4: Running Directly from Source (Python)
If running from source code (`python3 main.py`), you must ensure the following Debian packages and GTK4 libraries are installed:

| Library Package | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `python3` | Python runtime |
| `python3-gi` | Python GObject introspection bindings |
| `python3-gi-cairo` | Cairo vector graphics bindings for Python |
| `python3-requests` | HTTP library for querying the official CachyOS GitHub API |
| `gir1.2-gtk-4.0` | GTK 4.0 graphical toolkit |
| `gir1.2-adw-1` | Libadwaita 1.0 widget library (GNOME modern styling) |
| `libadwaita-1-0` | Libadwaita shared C libraries |
| `policykit-1` or `polkitd` | Provides `pkexec` for secure root privilege prompts |

Install all of them with a single command:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-gi python3-gi-cairo python3-requests \
    gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1 libadwaita-1-0 policykit-1
```

---

### 4. Kernel Compilation Dependencies
To compile the CachyOS kernel (`make bindeb-pkg`), your system requires standard Linux kernel compilation build tools:

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential libncurses-dev bison flex libssl-dev \
    libelf-dev bc rsync debhelper pahole dwarves sbsigntool mokutil openssl
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Compilation Duration Notice:**
> Compiling a full Linux kernel is an intensive task that utilizes all available CPU threads. The compilation process can take a while (typically anywhere from 15 to 45+ minutes) depending on the processing power, CPU core count, and cooling capabilities of your system.

---

## 🔐 Secure Boot & Kernel Signing

> [!WARNING]
> **Crucial for Systems with Secure Boot Enabled:**
> Custom compiled Linux kernels are not signed by Debian's official Microsoft-trusted EFI key. If your computer has **UEFI Secure Boot enabled**, your motherboard firmware will refuse to boot the newly compiled CachyOS kernel unless it is signed with a **Machine Owner Key (MOK)**.

### Option A: Atomic Post-Installation Kernel & DKMS Signing (Recommended)
The application provides integrated **Single-Transaction Privileged Helper Architecture**:
1. When **"Sign Kernel for UEFI Secure Boot After Installation"** is checked (safe default, pre-ticked across systems):
   - MOK certificates (`MOK.priv`, `MOK.der`, `MOK.pem`) are generated directly inside the **kernel output directory** alongside the compiled `.deb` packages (and mirrored to `/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/` for system/DKMS compatibility).
   - Certificates in the output folder are owned by the desktop user (`600` for `MOK.priv`, `644` for `MOK.der`/`pem`) so they can be retrieved or backed up without root permissions.
   - The app prompts for a one-time MOK enrollment password *only* if your key is not already enrolled in UEFI NVRAM.
   - A single `pkexec` authorization executes the atomic helper `sign-kernel.sh --install-and-sign <output_dir> [mok_pass]`.
   - The helper installs missing signing packages (`sbsigntool`, `mokutil`), extracts the exact kernel image from the `.deb`, installs via `dpkg -i`, signs `/boot/vmlinuz-*` via `sbsign`, signs DKMS modules, updates `initramfs` and `update-grub`, and stages MOK enrollment non-interactively via `mokutil --import`.
   - Installs a persistent Debian hook at `/etc/kernel/postinst.d/zz-cachyos-secureboot-sign` (chmod 0755) so future CachyOS kernel updates are signed automatically.
2. If the MOK key is enrolled on reboot, a clear MokManager walkthrough is displayed:
   - Select **Enroll MOK** -> **Continue** -> **Yes**.
   - Enter your chosen temporary password.
   - Select **Reboot** to boot into your newly signed kernel!
3. Standalone Actions:
   - Click **"🔒 Sign Installed Kernel (Secure Boot)"** to sign already-installed kernels and DKMS modules in `/boot` in a single transaction.
   - Click **"🔄 Reset MOK Keys"** (or `"🔄 Reset & Recreate MOK Keys"`) to cancel pending enrollments (`mokutil --revoke-import`), delete old keys, generate brand-new RSA-2048 MOK keys from scratch in the output folder, and re-sign your kernel.
   - Click **"📂 Open Folder"** next to *MOK Certificates & Packages Location* to directly inspect your `.deb` packages and `MOK.der`/`pem` files.

### Option B: CLI Signing with `sign-kernel.sh`
For headless systems or command-line workflows, use [`sign-kernel.sh`](sign-kernel.sh):
```bash
# Atomic install, sign, DKMS, initramfs, GRUB, and MOK enrollment:
sudo ./sign-kernel.sh --install-and-sign ~/kernel-build-deb/Linux-kernel-CachyOS-.../ [mok_password]

# Sign existing installed kernel in /boot and queue MOK:
sudo ./sign-kernel.sh --sign-only ~/kernel-build-deb/Linux-kernel-CachyOS-.../ auto [mok_password]

# Reset MOK keys from scratch, re-sign installed kernel, and queue new enrollment:
sudo ./sign-kernel.sh --reset-and-recreate ~/kernel-build-deb/Linux-kernel-CachyOS-.../ [mok_password]

# Check Secure Boot and MOK enrollment status without root:
./sign-kernel.sh --status [output_dir]
```

---

## Building from Source

### Build the Native Debian Package (`.deb`)
```bash
./build_deb.sh
```
This generates the ready-to-install package at `deb_dist/cachy-kernel-updater_1.1.2_all.deb`.

### Build the Standalone Flatpak Bundle (`.flatpak`)
```bash
./build_flatpak.sh
```
This compiles the application in an isolated Flatpak environment and produces `deb_dist/cachy-kernel-updater_1.1.2.flatpak`.

## 📜 Changelog

### v1.1.2
- **Fixed Missing Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Drivers (Safety Baseline Overhaul)**: Resolved issue where `make localmodconfig` stripped Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers and crypto algorithms that were not actively loaded into memory at compile-time.
- **Mandatory Wireless Cryptography Support**: Enforced kernel configs for `CONFIG_CRYPTO_CMAC`, `CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_HASH`, `CONFIG_CRYPTO_AES_NI_INTEL`, `CONFIG_CRYPTO_USER_API_SKCIPHER`, and related crypto ciphers, fixing daemon crashes with modern connection managers (`iwd`, `wpa_supplicant`, WPA2/WPA3-SAE, 802.11w/PMF).
- **Comprehensive Bluetooth Subsystem**: Enforced `CONFIG_BT_HIDP` (Bluetooth Human Interface Devices / input), `CONFIG_BT_HCIUART` (laptop serial UART Bluetooth), `CONFIG_BT_HCIBTUSB`, and vendor drivers (`CONFIG_BT_INTEL`, `BCM`, `RTL`, `MTK`).
- **Universal Wi-Fi Driver Preservation**: Enforced kernel modules for major Wi-Fi families (Intel `iwlwifi`/`iwlmvm`/`iwldvm`, Realtek `rtw88`/`rtw89`/`rtl8xxxu`, Qualcomm/Atheros `ath9k`/`ath10k`/`ath11k`/`ath12k`, MediaTek `mt76`/`mt7921`/`mt7925`, and Broadcom `brcmfmac`).
- **Seeded `host_lsmod.txt` Generation**: Seeded the `lsmod` snapshot with essential network, Bluetooth, and crypto modules so `streamline_config.pl` never removes dormant, unassociated, or rfkill-blocked wireless controllers.
- **Hardware Detection Reporting**: Added automatic detection and live reporting of system Wi-Fi adapters and Bluetooth controllers.
- **Updated Package Releases & APT Repository**: Bumped version to `1.1.2`, generated new Debian and Flatpak packages, and updated APT repository metadata.

### v1.1.1
- **New Vibrant Emblem Logo & Branding Palette**: Adopted modern low-poly CachyOS "C" rocket emblem with rich crimson (`#D82655`) and vibrant teal (`#00A896`), including matching GTK4/Adwaita custom CSS themes, status badges, and gradient progress bars.
- **Top System Status Card**: Enhanced top banner with app icon, version badge (`v1.1.1`), and integrated About dialog.
- **Guided 1-2-3 Step UI Workflow**: Streamlined the user interface into 3 clear cards with safe cross-system defaults pre-selected out-of-the-box (`localmodconfig`, stripped debug symbols, automated `.deb` installation, and post-install UEFI signing).
- **Dual Package Distribution**: Added standalone Flatpak bundle (`.flatpak`) alongside official Debian package (`.deb`).
- **Co-Located MOK Certificates**: Generated MOK certificates are stored directly in the kernel build output directory with user permissions.
- **Resolved `bindeb-pkg` Error 2**: Sanitized Debian/Canonical `.pem` certificate traps (`SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=""`, `SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS=""`, `MODULE_SIG_KEY=""`) and decoupled module signing from the compilation phase, enabling robust failure-free kernel builds natively and inside Podman/Docker containers.
- **Added Full Kernel 7.x & Packaging Dependencies**: Added `pahole`, `dwarves`, `sbsigntool`, `mokutil`, `openssl`, `fakeroot`, and `dpkg-dev` to `Containerfile`, `build_deb.sh`, and `kernel_manager.py`.
- **In-App Post-Build UEFI Secure Boot (MOK) Signing**: Automatically unpacks `linux-image-*.deb` packages post-compilation, signs internal `/boot/vmlinuz-*` binaries with `sbsign`, verifies cryptographic signatures via `sbverify`, and repacks `.deb` packages in-place.
- **In-App MOK Key Enrollment Wizard**: Integrated interactive dialog to stage MOK certificate enrollment into UEFI NVRAM (`pkexec mokutil --import`) with password validation and step-by-step reboot guidance for MokManager.
- **Standalone Security Signing Tools**: Added UI rows and CLI arguments (`--sign-deb-mok`, `--status-sb`, `--enroll-mok`) for on-demand package signing and MOK management.

### v1.0.6
- Added experimental "Compile for my system" hardware-tailored kernel build with CPU detection and `make localmodconfig`.
